## Disclosure policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure. We ask that you give us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure. We will credit reporters in the release notes unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope

This policy covers the Ansible playbooks, roles, templates, and Docker Compose configurations in this repository. It does not cover:

- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies (report those to the respective maintainers).
- Misconfigurations in user deployments that deviate from documented procedures.
- Social engineering or phishing attacks against individual contributors.
